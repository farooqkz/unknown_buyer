# Unknown Buyer
## We buy unknown items from you!
Server's admin has disabled a mod and you have some unknown items in your
stock? It doesn't matter because we buy unknown items from you and give you
random items!
This mod gives the user random stuff for every 10 unknown item which user
has.It doesn't have any craft recipe so just admins can have these.
random items could be changed with changing source code, there is an array
named `bonus_items` and you should specify chance of each item.

### Usage
#### for Admins
Get one with /giveme and place it where players can use it.
#### for Players
Right click with at least 10 unknown items and get your bonus spawned in front
of the chest.
